PRESENT ILLNESS: Pt is a 72 yo female with h/o metastatic breast CA(currently undergoing chemo/XRT), HTN, chronic CA-related pain who is transferred from an OSH with ICH/SAH. She has fallen several times in the past few days by report. She also fell at least twice on day before admission. She developed a hematoma periorbitally on the right during one fall ~24 hours ago. Then, she fell again and her husband was unable to get her up. At this  point, it is unclear whether the ambulance was called, or whether her daughter who is a nurse arrived, but she was then taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital. In reviewing their notes, she was sedate but  arousable there. Her pupils were also described as equal and reactive at 3 mm bilaterally. There, she was found to have a large ICH with subarachnoid blood and ventricular extension. She  had an INR>8 at that time. She had a nasal airway placed, received cerebyx 1 g IV, Vit K 1 mg SQ, FFP, and Ativan 1 mg IV.  She was then transferred here. It is unclear what her exact mental status, level of arousability was upon transfer from OSH,  but she was awake and agitated for some of her time there. It appears she may have been slightly worsened before transfer, but  unclear from notes. In the ED here, she was described and unarousable when she arrived(unclear of pupils). She was intubated, given Proplex and  Mannitol 140 mg IV. She was then continued on propofol here. A repeat CT scan revealed similar picture to the OSH scan(have only seen report of that CT scan). She has a focus of hemorrhage in the right frontotemporal white matter with extension to all of her ventricles. She also has hydrocephalus with temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] enlargement and a large amount of blood in the 4th ventricle, likely causing obstruction. She has a right frontal contusion that is separate from her largest area of bleeding. She also has  subarachnoid blood present fairly diffusely. It is unclear whether any metastases are present and she has no known brain mets. Since arrival here, she has been unresponsive and without meaningful neurologic function.

PRESENT ILLNESS: 67M CAD, DM2, COPD on 4L of home O2, HTN, asbestos exposure (asbestosis?), OSA on nocturnal Bipap, admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2128-5-3**] with subacute respiratory distress, started on broad spectrum antibiotics, transfered to MICU this AM because of worsening respiratory distress, found to have multifocal pneumonia, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Patient has been admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] multiple times in the last few weeks.  He was admitted most recently to [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2128-5-3**] at which time he was not able to provide much clinical history but had been having worsening shortness of breath as well as significant diarrhea and fever to 103F, stating that he had been feeling sick for a long time.  He was noted to be somewhat somnolent, easily falling asleep, increased oxygen requirement.  He had also reported increasing weight and leg edema over the last several days to weeks.  He was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Cipro in the ED for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage after right-sided infiltrate was seen on CXR.   On morning of transfer, patient's O2sat was noted to desat to 50% on Cpap while on the floor, so he was palced on high flow non-rebreather with improvement in O2sat to 96%.  He was given a dose of IV lasix 80mg x1.  ABG showed hypoxemia and hyercapnea, though hypercapnea was presumed to be at his baseline.  CXR done also in setting of spiking fevers showed new developing infiltrate.  He was transfered to CCU for worsening multifocal pneumonia and heart failure.  ABG was 7.38/60/107 on 10L O2 by facemask. Family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  On arrival, the patient was in no acute distress but having some difficulty breathing.  He was transitioned from non-rebreather during transport to CPAP on 6L NC.  He did have a large loose bowel movement on arrival.  States that cough is worsening but can not cough out sputum.  He denies nausea currently, but states that he did have an episode of emesis earlier today. Patient states that abdomen has been increasingly distended over the last several weeks, as well as increased lower extremity edema.  He believes he has gained 40 lbs in the last couple of months.  Over the phone, his wife believes the patient had an aspiration episode at some point in the last few weeks, though unclear when, perhaps at home; wife has been in the hospital for a few weeks, so she does not know details of recent history well.  Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] [**Date range (1) 89899**] for presumed COPD exacerbation triggered by viral illness, including self-limited nausea/vomiting, diarrhea.  He had a fever to 100.8, no pneumonia seen on CXR, negative blood cultures.  He was given a dose of IV solumedrol and started on a prednisone taper.   He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 17717**] for ankle edema and atypical chest pain, diuresed effectively, thought to have poor compliance with low sodium diet.
